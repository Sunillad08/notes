**Path**|**Description**
:-:|:-
**/**|The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted as well as the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all of the other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories of the root.
**/bin**|Contains essential command binaries.
**/boot**|Consists of the static bootloader, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS.
**/dev**|Contains device files to facilitate access to every hardware device attached to the system.
**/etc**|Local system configuration files. Configuration files for installed applications may be saved here as well.
**/home**|Each user on the system has a subdirectory here for storage.
**/lib**|Shared library files that are required for system boot.
**/media**|External removable media devices such as USB drives are mounted here.
**/mnt**|Temporary mount point for regular filesystems.
**/opt**|Optional files such as third-party tools can be saved here.

**/srv**|service data is stored here.
**/sys**|Interacting with system , created everytime system boots
